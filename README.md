# BoxColliderGizmo
The "BoxColliderGizmo" script allows you to visualize box colliders in the Unity Editor by drawing gizmos around them. It collects all the box colliders in the children of the script's parent object and automatically updates the collection whenever a child collider is added or removed. The gizmos are drawn using the OnDrawGizmosSelected() and OnDrawGizmos() methods, giving you a visual representation of the collider's position and size. This script can be useful during development to visually inspect and adjust box colliders without the need to enter play mode.
